This plugin will access the Yelp API and StrawPoll API to create polls based on a specific business category and city location that can then be shared to social media allowing your followers to engage and vote for which business they think is the best

## Description ##

Business Matchup helps you generate content by allowing you to specify a specific location and business category to pull information about the top 3 rated businesses in a given city. It then uses this information to create a StrawPoll and generates the necessary content to create a custom post that you can then share on Social Media.
